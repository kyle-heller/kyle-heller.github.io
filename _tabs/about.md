I'm Kyle Heller — a Technical Lead at Veeam Software transitioning into platform engineering.

I've spent seven years supporting cloud service provider partners, which means I've seen more production infrastructure failures than most people see in a career. That experience shapes how I think about building reliable platforms.

My background is unconventional: I studied Social Work at Ohio State before pivoting to tech, then completed an MS in Computer Science at CU Boulder with graduate certificates in Data Science and AI. I hold Azure Solutions Architect Expert, CKA, CCNA, Terraform Associate, and VMCE certifications.

Outside of work, I build things at Nightforge Systems, make industrial electronic music as Ritual Neglect, and try to keep up with a toddler.

I'm based in Columbus, Ohio.

Nora Heller was born today.

I've spent years optimizing systems, chasing certifications, grinding through coursework, and building toward the next thing. Today none of that mattered at all, and it was the best day of my life.

No technical lessons. No career advice. Just a small human who has no idea how much she's already changed everything.

Regular programming resumes eventually.

No rush.

I applied to Georgia Tech's OMSCS program in early 2024. It's one of the most accessible and respected online CS master's programs in the country, and it was the obvious target for someone like me: a working professional with a non-CS undergrad trying to break into a formal CS education without quitting my job.

I didn't get in.

## The First Rejection

The first rejection came around May 2024. I'd spent a year and a half preparing with CS50x, The Odin Project, Nand2Tetris, Georgia Tech's own edX courses in Object-Oriented Programming and Data Structures, and a discrete math course at Ohio State. I thought my application was strong. Apparently it wasn't strong enough.

The rejection email doesn't tell you much. You're left to guess. Was it the social work undergrad? Was my statement of purpose not technical enough? Were my prerequisite courses insufficient? You don't know, and the not-knowing is its own kind of frustrating.

I spent about a week being pretty upset about it. Mostly just stewing. Then I started working on the application again.

## The Second Rejection

I reapplied for the fall cycle. I tightened my statement of purpose, highlighted my technical work at Veeam more prominently, and emphasized the self-study trajectory: the progression from CS50x to Georgia Tech's own coursework to formal math at OSU. I thought the narrative was clear: this person is serious, capable, and has a track record of completing rigorous material.

The second rejection came around August 2024. Same result. No detailed feedback.

That one hurt more than the first. When you get rejected once, you can tell yourself it was a fluke or that your application had fixable gaps. When you get rejected twice, you start questioning whether the path is viable at all. Maybe someone with a social work degree just doesn't get into CS graduate programs. Maybe the gatekeeping is real and permanent.

## What I Did Next

I gave myself a weekend to be miserable about it. Ate too much pizza. Watched bad movies. Then I started researching other programs.

CU Boulder's MSCS program had been on my radar but I'd been fixated on Georgia Tech because of the price point and reputation. When I actually looked at Boulder's curriculum, I found something that might have been a better fit all along: graduate certificates in Data Science and AI built into the degree, a broader course selection, and an admissions process that seemed to weigh professional experience more heavily.

I started the process to be admitted to CU Boulder around October 2024. I got formally admitted in November.

## The Lesson Isn't What You Think

The easy takeaway is "persistence pays off." And sure, it does. But that's not the real lesson for me.

The real lesson is that I was so locked into one specific path, Georgia Tech's OMSCS, that I almost missed a program that was arguably better suited to my goals. CU Boulder's data science and AI certificates ended up being directly relevant to the infrastructure career I've been building. The ethics courses shaped how I think about building systems. The networking curriculum connected directly to my day-to-day troubleshooting.

Would I have gotten the same value from Georgia Tech? Maybe. But I wouldn't have gotten the specific combination of coursework that CU Boulder offered, and that combination turned out to matter.

## For Anyone in the Same Position

If you're applying to CS programs with a non-traditional background, here's what I'd tell you:

Apply broadly. Don't put all your emotional investment into one program. The program that rejects you isn't necessarily the one that would have served you best.

Your non-traditional background is not a weakness to overcome. It's a perspective to leverage. My social work degree and six years in technical support gave me professional experience that most CS applicants don't have. The programs that value that experience are the ones where you'll thrive.

Rejection is information, not a verdict. Georgia Tech said no twice, and I'll never know exactly why. But what I do know is that CU Boulder said yes, and the education I got there was excellent. The path worked out. It just didn't look like I expected it to.
